Enjoy Espresso systems coffee-run! 

Please help Ser Ben catch enough caffeine to boost interop, scalability & decentralization even further! Collect coffee's, jump over the objects and try to get as fat as it's possible. 
Note that different cups give you different amount of game points (i.e. it's like having an americano, double-espresso or latte). 
Please share your results in X and tag @Ychaser11 if you liked it.
